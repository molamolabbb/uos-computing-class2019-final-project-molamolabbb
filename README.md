## Datas
This is Titanic survivor data from kaggle (Very Well-known!).
The data separated two, one is __training set__ and the other is __test set__.
Both data sets include features of the passengers(like sex, age, ticket-class...).
The differences of data sets are training set has survival and the other has not. 
Training set will be machine-learned.
