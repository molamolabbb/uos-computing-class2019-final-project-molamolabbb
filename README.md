## Datas
This is Titanic survivor data from kaggle (Very Well-known!).
The data separated two, one is __training set__ and the other is __test set__.
Both data sets include features of the passengers(like sex, age, ticket-class...).
The differences of data sets are training set has survival and the other has not. 
Training set will be machine-learned.
and test set is iterally speaking tested.

### Data information
I manufactured the kaggle datas because don't need variables.
Here is the Variables i used.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 __variables__ & __Definition__ & meaning of the number \\
 survival & Survival & 0 = NO, 1 = Yes \\ 
 pclass & Ticket class & 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd  \\ 
 sex & Sex & male = 0, female = 1  \\ 
 age & age & missig value = mean value(29.6)\\
 sibsp & the number of siblings/spouses abroad the titanic & \\
 parch & the number of parents/children abroad the titanic & \\
